### What is a Data Logger
- An electronic instrument that records measurements at set intervals over a period of time
- Compact, battery-power device equipped with an internal microprocessor, data storage, and one or more sensors
- Indoors, outdoors, underwater sensors are available
- Can record data for up to years at a time (depending on memory and battery life)

### How to use a Data Logger
- Download and install software on mobile device or laptop
- Connect to data logger and launch parameters
- Place in the desired location and record data for a desired period of time
- Reconnect to a data logger via mobile device or laptop
- Download the data file and readout with analysis software

### How to select a Data Logger
#### Ask:
-  What do I need to measure, where, and for how long?
-   Is this a one-time situation or part of an ongoing project or toolkit?
-    How often will I access data and how would I like access to it?
#### Addition considerations:
- Measurement accuracy
- Data access options
- Software capabilities
- Battery life
- Cost of Ownership
- Product support


#### Environmental and Agrigultural Measurements
- Weather - Temp/RH, PAR, Light Intensity, Rainfall, Wind speed, Wind direction, Solar radiation, Leaf wetness
- Soil - Moisture, Moisture/Temperature, Electrical Conductivity, Soil water potential, Multi-depth Moisture/Temp
- Other - 4-20mA signals, Pulse signals, 0-24VDC signals, Tilt/Accelaration

#### How to collect your data
- USB Communication and Optic Communication
	- Easy-to-use, affordable, self-contained durable loggers
- **Bluetooth (what we use)**
	- Designed for convenient wireless setup and download from mobile devices
- Stations 
	- Options for cellular systems with remote access to data and alarm notifications

#### Standalone data loggers
- Manual Data access
- Highly accurate
- easy to deploy
- durable
- affordable

#### HOBOware Pro - USB and Optic Communication software
- Simple menus for fast easy logger setup and readout
- scaling to real-world engineering
- presentation-quality graphs
- easy export of data files (txt or excel)
- fast set-up and readout
- advanced plotting tools for precise data analysis
- access to data assistants for post-processing data

#### HOBOconnect
- easily locate and view all loggers within range, with no pairing required
- configure, readout, start and stop the logger from the app

#### Remote Cloud Monitoring
- **RX2100 Station**
	- Small, compact, low-cost station with cellular communication to the web
	- outdoor monitoring applications with integrated 1.7W solar panel
	- optional HOBOnet and water level versions
- **RX3000**
  - Robust, flexible, rugged station with 4G cellular communication options to the web
  - Slots for 2 modules: HOBOnet and Analog input - 4 channels
  - Relay module
  - Water level module

#### HOBOlink
- Create custom dashboards
	- clearly see the information you need
  - easily share dashboards with others, simply share a link or embed in web pages
- view on any device with web access
- instant remote alarm notifications via text or email
- View all stations on a map
- Click on a station to see current conditions (requires station with cell service)

#### Environmental Research and Protection Applications
- Climate
- Environmental Compliance
- Renewable Energy
- Green Space
- Ecology
