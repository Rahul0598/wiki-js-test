This webinar goes over all types of sensors and the proper set-up and maintenance for them. These notes will focus on the MX and RX data logger series.


## MX Sensor

### Set-Up

1. Make sure you know the area
	a. Where you are setting up the sensor
	b. Possible hazards
	c. Extra measures for sensor safety (see MX Sensor Maintenance)
2. Know how to set up the sensor (see "Whatever the name is of the MX2302 sensor setup" page)
2. If there isn't cell service, download or print the information sheet beforehand
	a. This shouldn't be a problem on campus
2. Make sure the sensor is securely mounted
2. Do not over-tighten the holding cable as it may cause the case to distort and allow water to enter the inside of the logger
2. Do not mount upside down (wire should come out the bottom of the case)
2. Wrap excess wire around something

### Station Tools

1. Small Phillips head screwdriver
1. Flat head screwdriver
1. Large tie wraps

### MX Sensor Maintenance

1. Wipe down the radiation shield if dirty
1. Inspect wire for breaks and damage 
	a. Use electrical tape to close the problem
	b. If you see the cause, remove it
1. Make sure the wire is secure (not loose) and preventing water from entering the data logger (drip loops)

> Troubleshooting Tips
{.is-danger}


1. Device is not seen in HOBOconnect range
	a. Press the button again
	b. in Bluetooth range (shouldn't be a problem for us)
	c. Are the batteries installed correctly?
	d. Restart the mobile device to reset cellular connection
	e. Turn on airplane mode with Bluetooth enabled to get rid of any interference


## RX Sensor

### Set-Up

1. Make sure you know the area
	a. Where you are setting up the sensor
	b. Possible hazards
	c. Extra measures for sensor safety (see RX Sensor Maintenance)
1. Know how to set up the sensor (see "Whatever the name is of the RX2302 sensor setup" page)
1. If there isn't cell service, download or print the information sheet beforehand
1. Proper orientation
	a. Solar panels facing correct way
	b. Wind direction sensors facing correct way
1. Sensors clear for proper measurements
	a. all sensors away from tree canopies and other structures (unless intentional)

### Station Tools
1. Wire cutters
1. Large tie wraps
1. Flathead screwdriver
1. Phillips head screwdriver
1. various size wrenches or sockets (1/2, 5/16, 7/16, 10- and 11-mm)

### RX Sensor Maintenance

1. Wipe down outside casing if dirty (prevents deterioration)
1. Inspect wires for breaks and damages
	a. use electrical tape to correct it
	b. remove problem if visible
1. Make sure the wire is secure (not loose) and preventing water from entering the data logger (drip loops)

### Troubleshooting Tips
1. No connection to HOBOlink
	a.Check cell service
			- Check with carrier to make sure you have service in that area 
			- move logger to higher location if possible
	b.Check that both the battery and solar power are plugged in
	c.Press the cloud button
1. RXW sensor connection issues
	a.Check terrain/range
	b.Make sure the station is in search mode
	c.This is where the second person comes in handy
