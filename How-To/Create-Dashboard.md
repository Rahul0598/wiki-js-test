1. Go to the Dashboard page in HOBOLink.
1. Should see a list of ‘Your Dashboards’ with a button labeled ‘Create new dashboard’ at the top.
1. Click on that button, which should take you to a blank editing page with a list of the sensors on the left hand side.
1. Choose the sensor and type of data you want in the graph. A new widget should appear in the editing page.
	- The time frame will automatically be set to the past day. If you want to change that, you have to click the first drop down menu and click past week or past month.
	- The widget will say ‘No data to display’. Leave it for a couple of minutes for the data to populate from HOBOLink.
1. To add other sensors to the same widget, click on the tool button in the top right corner of the widget.
	- A message with the title ‘Line Graph’ should appear.
	- Make sure you are on the Data page.
	- In Channels, start typing ‘TRH_DL’ and a list of the in-situ sensors should come up.
	- Choose the ones you want to include in your comparison graph (I would suggest making the data come from all one sensor (ex. Temperature, RH, Dew Point from TRH_DL_1), or having the data be all one type (ex. Temperature from sensors 1,2,3… etc.))
1. You can have up to 10 widgets in one dashboard.
1. You can rename your dashboard in the Dashboard Name section (It automatically populates it with ‘Dashboard “Date you created it”’)
1. Once you are finished creating the dashboard, save it.
1. Once a dashboard is saved, you can go back to edit it using the tool button on the right side of that dashboard box.
